//! # nam-rs
//!
//! Pure-Rust, real-time-safe inference for [Neural Amp Modeler] (NAM) `.nam` models.
//!
//! This crate loads a `.nam` model file and runs its neural network forward pass —
//! a whole buffer at a time (WaveNet uses a cache-friendly block kernel), or one
//! sample at a time — with no heap allocation on the audio (hot) path. It is a
//! from-scratch Rust port of NAM's inference, written against the reference
//! implementations below and validated for **bit-level parity** against them.
//!
//! Three model shapes are supported through the architecture-agnostic [`Model`] enum,
//! which dispatches on the `.nam`'s declared architecture so you never branch on it
//! yourself: **WaveNet**, **LSTM**, and **SlimmableContainer** (NAM "A2"). A
//! `SlimmableContainer` is a thin multiplexer over a set of complete standalone
//! submodels (each WaveNet or LSTM); a width dial selects the active one as a
//! CPU/quality trade-off. Drive it via [`Model::as_slimmable_mut`] →
//! [`Slimmable::set_slim_size`] / [`Slimmable::select`]. Switching is real-time-safe
//! (a single index write); each submodel keeps its own state, so switching mid-stream
//! leaves a short warmup transient on the newly-selected submodel.
//!
//! Deferred A2 features (`condition_dsp`, FiLM, bottleneck, gated/multi-tap heads,
//! per-layer activation lists, exotic activations) are **rejected** with
//! [`Error::UnsupportedFeature`] rather than silently mis-run.
//!
//! **Sample rate.** A `.nam` is captured at a specific rate
//! ([`NamModel::expected_sample_rate`], 48 kHz when the file does not say). `nam-rs`
//! does *not* resample — you must feed the model audio at that rate, or resample in
//! your host first. A mismatched rate produces silently wrong output, because the
//! model's dilations and recurrence are defined in samples, not seconds.
//!
//! **Processing boundary.** `nam-rs` runs only the model's forward pass (plus its
//! `head_scale`). The reference NAM plugin additionally applies a DC blocker
//! (high-pass) and, optionally, loudness normalization on the output — those are the
//! host's responsibility, not the model's, so they live in your audio graph, not here.
//! The calibration accessors ([`NamModel::loudness`] etc.) give you the numbers to do
//! that gain-staging yourself.
//!
//! ## Design contract
//!
//! 1. **Parity with the reference.** The forward pass must produce output equal
//!    (within float tolerance) to the canonical Python/C++ NAM implementations for
//!    the same `.nam` file and input. This is enforced by `tests/parity.rs`.
//! 2. **Real-time safety.** The runtime's `process_buffer` (on both [`WaveNet`] and
//!    [`Lstm`], reached via [`Model`]) performs zero heap allocations, locks, or
//!    system calls. All scratch buffers are pre-allocated at construction. This is
//!    enforced by `tests/rt_safety.rs`.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! use nam_rs::{NamModel, Model};
//!
//! // From disk you'd use `NamModel::from_file("model.nam")?`.
//! // Here we use a tiny in-line model for illustration.
//! let json = r#"{
//!     "version": "0.5.4", "architecture": "WaveNet",
//!     "config": {
//!         "layers": [{
//!             "input_size": 1, "condition_size": 1, "channels": 1, "head_size": 1,
//!             "kernel_size": 1, "dilations": [1], "activation": "ReLU",
//!             "gated": false, "head_bias": false
//!         }],
//!         "head": null, "head_scale": 1.0
//!     },
//!     "weights": [1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]
//! }"#;
//!
//! let model = NamModel::from_json_str(json)?;
//! let mut amp = Model::from_nam(&model)?;   // picks the architecture from the file
//!
//! // On the audio thread: process in place, no allocation.
//! let mut buffer = [0.1_f32, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4];
//! amp.process_buffer(&mut buffer);
//! # Ok::<(), nam_rs::Error>(())

//! This is a derivative work. The algorithm and weight layout are ported from the
//! following projects (see `NOTICE` for license texts):

//!   (Python, MIT). The source of truth for `export_weights` / `export_config`.
